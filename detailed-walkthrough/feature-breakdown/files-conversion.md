# Files Conversion

CS.DataLabel supports files conversion to ease the users in labeling data in formats suitable for AI modeling. 

The motivation of this is there are formats that are not commonly used for data ingestion such as document formats \(doc, docx, pdf\) or image formats with more than 3 color channels \(tif, tiff\).

### 1.0 Supported File Format

The file formats below are supported for the conversion. Users can choose accordingly from each category for the conversion of file format from one type to another.

#### File Format to Convert From

1. PDF
2. TIF

#### File Format to Convert To

1. JPG
2. PNG

CS.DataLabel team will continue to support more ﬁle types based on demands.
