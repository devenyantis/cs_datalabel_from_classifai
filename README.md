# Overview

## **Data Annotation Platform for AI Training**

![](.gitbook/assets/aics_v2_output-04_white-1-.png)

**CS.DataLabel** is one of the most comprehensive open-source data annotation platform. It supports the labelling of various data types with multi labelled outputs forms for AI model training.

Data labelling tasks are challenging due to a few factors:

* long hours of human workforce to label the data manually,
* off-the-shelves toolkit which cannot fulﬁll the use cases needs.
* frustration processes to convert data to supported format types for labelling work

We aim to solve these in CS.DataLabel to provide signiﬁcant value to the data science workﬂow.

## Features

* Platform-agnostic
  * CS.DataLabel is build with Java backend. As Java is platform-neutral, it is as simple as download the CS.DataLabel uber jar ﬁle and run it with Java runtime.
* Asynchronous API - Fast and speedy response In-memory Java-based database
* Conversion of conventional data types to preferred formats \(For example: .pdf format to .png format\)
* Multi data types supported

| Image | Document | Video | Tabular | Voice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| jpg, JPEG, JPG | pdf | Coming soon... | Coming soon... | Coming soon... |
| png, PNG |  |  |  |  |
| tif, tiff |  |  |  |  |
| bmp |  |  |  |  |

* \[Still WIP. Stay tune with these features coming up below\]
  * **AI in the Loop** - Deep Learning assistant for labelling task to reclaim valuable time for meaningful ML/DL tasks.
  * Support labelling of more data types in demand - video, tabular and voice data.
  * Data management

## Strengths of the tool

* Scale data labelling operations to massive real world dataset 
* Cut costly data labelling services
* Aesthetic and intuitive UI interface, to make the work fun to do!
* Reclaim valuable time from ineﬃcient data labelling, technical team can focus on more meaningful ML/DL tasks.
