# Overview

## **Data Annotation Platform for AI Training**

![](.gitbook/assets/0%20%2813%29.jpeg)

**Classifai** is one of the most comprehensive open-source data annotation platform. It supports the labelling of various data types with multi labelled outputs forms for AI model training.

Figure below show how Classifai ﬁts in the machine learning workﬂow. It enables the labelling of raw data imported from data source. 

The labelled data can then channel into training environments for supervised / semi- supervised learning.

Data labelling tasks are challenging due to a few factors:

* long hours of human workforce to label the data manually,
* off-the-shelves toolkit which cannot fulﬁll the use cases needs.
* frustration processes to convert data to supported format types for labelling work

We aim to solve these in **Classifai** to provide signiﬁcant value to the data science workﬂow.

## Features

* Platform-agnostic
  * Classifai is build with Java backend. As Java is platform-neutral, it is as simple as download the classifai uber jar ﬁle and run it with Java runtime.
* Asynchronous API - Fast and speedy response In-memory Java-based database
* Conversion of conventional data types to preferred formats \(For example: .pdf format to .png format\)
* Multi data types supported

| Image | Document | Video | Tabular | Voice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| jpg, JPEG, JPG | pdf | Coming soon... | Coming soon... | Coming soon... |
| png, PNG |  |  |  |  |
| tif, tiff |  |  |  |  |
| bmp |  |  |  |  |

* \[Still WIP. Stay tune with these features coming up below\]
  * **AI in the Loop** - Deep Learning assistant for labelling task to reclaim valuable time for meaningful ML/DL tasks.
  * Support labelling of more data types in demand - video, tabular and voice data.
  * Data management

## Strengths of the tool

* Scale data labelling operations to massive real world dataset 
* Cut costly data labelling services
* Aesthetic and intuitive UI interface, to make the work fun to do!
* Reclaim valuable time from ineﬃcient data labelling, technical team can focus on more meaningful ML/DL tasks.
